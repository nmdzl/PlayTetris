# PlayTetris

This program is the individual course project of [NCSU CSC 561](https://cgclass.csc.ncsu.edu) (Principles of Computer Graphics) in 2020 Fall semester.

The goal is to implement Tetris with JavaScript and OpenGL API to render the game board, interactive objects, both 2D and 3D viewing and Blinn-Phong lighting effect.

The program entirely used OpenGL functions without third party libraries. And a simple interface is developed with HTML/CSS.
